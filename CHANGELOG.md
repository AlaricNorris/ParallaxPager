Change Log
==========

Version 2.0.0 *(2015-02-17)*
----------------------------

 * Release should be mostly backwards compatible with v1.0.0, but the sweeping changes to the
   subsystem merited a major bump.
 * Bugfix: Fix targeting API v21
 * New: Ability to add custom listeners to the View creation process.
   This is to help work around an issue with trying to have multiple ContextWrappers meddle with
   the view creation process. See sample project for Calligraphy example.
